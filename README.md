# Ansible MySQL Role

An ansible role to provision MySQL in a server.

The role is packaged in a way that only the *var files* should be modified to set installation specifics.

To use just copy the contents to the *roles/mysql* folder inside your ansible structure and add the role *mysql* to the playbook.
